# PrinterConnect

## Democratizing access to 3D printers

PrinterConnect is a web application connecting hardware designers,
makers, engineers with 3D printers wherever they are.

It is presently a work in progress and will be available on www.printerconnect.com or www.printerconnect.org.

Long term, PrinterConnects hopes to democratize access to high-resolution 3D printers for just about anybody who has a 3D model, access to a web browser, and patience to wait for the printing and shipping of their components.
