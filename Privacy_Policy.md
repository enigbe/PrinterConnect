<div align="'center">
This document contains details about the private data PrinterConnect collects

protected. It also contains information that pertains to the user's rights to modify,

## About PrinterConnect
PrinterConnect is an application that allows people seeking access to
a wide range of additive manufacturing devices, materials and service 
providers to connect, build, and ship products. Its primary goal is to 
democratize access to 3D printers and other CNC machines.

The connection is achieved thus:
1. Clients create user accounts to upload 3D models of products they 
want printed (machined), specifying details includiing material type,
   mesh fraction, build volume, etc. These users find and match 3D 
   printers for their products.
2. Device owners - who could be any of the following: businesses, makerspaces,
hobbyists - create user accounts to receive requests from client users whose 
   build request(s) match their device specifications.
3. With established connection between client users and device owners,
built products can be shipped to, or picked up from select locations.

## Data PrinterConnect collects
To build a thriving ecosystem, PrinterConnect must collect, save, and protect sensitive
user data. We collect the following kinds of data:
1. User first and last name
2. User email
3. User password
4. User avatar
5. User delivery address or pick-up location
6. User digital payment information
With the ubiquitous nature of social media, user accounts can be easily created, with permission,
   from data shared from accounts such as twitter, facebook, google, and github. PrinterConnect 
   will collect only email, screen_name/usernames, and first and last names.

## Why PrinterConnect collects the aforementioned data
We collect full name, email, and password data because each client and business user must be 
uniquely identified and verified to connect on our platform. It is especially important because
to enable the creation of experience and resolution of problems unique to each user. 
The delivery address is where completed print jobs can be couriered to or picked up from. The
delivery address does not have to be an exact living address for client users, it can be any 
address their products can be shipped to, of which they have easy access to. The same goes for 
pick-up location and business users (device owners).

## How PrinterConnect protects user data
All user passwords are currently encrypted. Access to user data cannot be gained by unauthorized 
persons. All payment information will only be processed with trusted payment service providers
including Stripe, Paystack, Flutterwave, and Paga. No sensitive card information is collected and
saved by PrinterConnect

## User privacy controls
Verified and signed-in users can modify user information, updating passwords, usernames, full names,
avatar, and email addresses (with identity re-verification). Accounts can also be deactivated, deleted,
and user data exported to json/xml formats for easy transfer.

## What user data is shared
PrinterConnect does not share user information with other companies. Only with explicit user permission
is delivery location shared with courier service providers to complete a transaction. The same applies 
to debit/credit card data to complete payment. All data shared is done with payment and delivery companies
renowned for privacy preservation.

## Regulatory compliance and co-operation
To comply with regulatory policies, whatever user data requested by these bodies will be done in ways that
are privacy-preserving. Data to show user trends, revenue generated, and other non-personally identifiable 
information will be shared.
